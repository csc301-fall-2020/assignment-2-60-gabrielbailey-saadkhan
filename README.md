# a2-starter

Run the main Flask module by running `python3 PizzaParlour.py`

Run unit tests with coverage by running `pytest --cov-report term --cov=. tests/unit_tests.py`


Pair Programming Features:
1. Submit an order
	Includes implementing all the objects that define an order/pizza/drink
2. Ask for Pickup or Delivery
	Includes implementing reading of JSON and csv filetypes

3. Update existing order/ Cancel Order
	Needs to be taken into consideration during 1. but should then be quick?
4. Ask for the menu
	Either the full menu or price of an item. Details up to us so can be short?

Suggest 1 & 2 for the two pair programming sessions. If you have modifications, make them, and if you would rather be driver or navigator for one of them, claim them.
